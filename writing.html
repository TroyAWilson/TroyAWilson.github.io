                    <p>Come on, sit down.</p>
                    <p>I have ideas for stories, primarily short horror stories inspired by a mix of creepypastas/internet horror I enjoy and some works by HP. Lovecraft and those who have made addition to the lovecraftian mythos.</p>
                    <p>Currently, however, I have nothing truley concrete to share. I do have two loose ideas I want to document here that I hope to one day make into full stories.</p>
                    
                    <!-- Ideas -->
                    <h3>Idea 1: Too Many Faces [tentative title]</h3>
                    <p>This story follows a young man who lives in a mountain town named Sycamore Falls who starts to notice sometimes people aren't quite right.</p>
                    <i>"I high-fived Peter in celebration. That's when I noticed his face seemed to waver--slipping, settling, and reforming like he couldn't quite remember which expression fit"</i>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <i>"The sound it made when it spoke was my voice, almost. It was a tone that did not pass through lungs but through something vast and hollow imitating the human throat"</i>

                    <h3>Idea 2: Garden at the Edge of WestWell</h3>
                    <p>A story told in the form of journal entries written by a Horticulturist living deep within an abandoned garden at the edge of a forgotten town.</p>
                    <p>The entries slip further into madness as the garden's secrets unravel.</p>
                    <i>"Vines bleed clear luminous fluid that smell of honey and rust."</i>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <i>"I dreamed again woke with soil under my nails. I find myself longing for the next dream"</i>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <i>"To lie down in her warmth is to return to the first thought of creation -- to become seed and song and soil again. Do not come looking for me, only her. And she will welcome you too."</i>
